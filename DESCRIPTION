Description: Radiomics image analysis toolbox for 2D and 3D radiological images. RIA supports DICOM, NIfTI,
             nrrd and npy (numpy array) file formats.
             RIA calculates first-order, gray level co-occurrence matrix, gray level run length matrix and
             geometry-based statistics. Almost all calculations are done using vectorized formulas to
             optimize run speeds. Calculation of several thousands of parameters only takes minutes
             on a single core of a conventional PC. Detailed methodology has been published: Kolossvary
