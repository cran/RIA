\arguments{
\item{filename}{string, file path to directory containing \emph{dcm} files.}

\item{mask_filename}{string vector, file path to optional directory containing \emph{dcm} files
of mask image. If multiple are supplied, then those voxels are kept which have one of the values of \emph{keep_mask_values}
in any of the supplied masks.}

\item{keep_mask_values}{integer vector or string, indicates which value or values of the mask image
to use as indicator to identify voxels wished to be processed. Usually 1-s indicate voxels
wished to be processed. However, one mask image might contain several segmentations, in which
case supplying several integers is allowed. Furthermore, if the same string is supplied to
\emph{filename} and \emph{mask_filename}, then the integers in \emph{keep_mask_values} are used
to specify which voxel values to analyze. This way the provided image can be segmented to specific
components. For example, if you wish to analyze only the low-density non-calcified component
of coronary plaques, then \emph{keep_mask_values} can specify this by setting it to: -100:30.
If  a single string is provided, then each element of the mask will be examined against the statement in the string.
For example, if \emph{'>0.5'} is provided i.e. the mask is probabilities after a DL algorithm, then all
voxels with values >0.5 in the mask image will be kept. This can be a complex logical expression.
The data on which the expression is executed is called \emph{data} or \emph{data_mask}, depending on whether
you wish to filter the original image, that is the original image is supplied as a mask, or if you have
unique mask files respectively. Therefore for complex logical expressions you can define for example:
\emph{'>-100 & data<30'} to consider data values between -100 and 30, or \emph{'>0.5 & data_mask<0.75'}
to select voxels based-on mask values between 0.5 and 0.75 for example if they represent a probability mask.}

\item{switch_z}{logical, indicating whether to change the orientation of the images in the Z axis. Some
software reverse the order of the manipulated image in the Z axis, and therefore the images of the mask
image need to be reversed.}

\item{crop_in}{logical, indicating whether to crop \emph{RIA_image} to smallest bounding box.}

\item{replace_in}{logical, whether to replace smallest values indicated by \emph{zero_value},
which are considered to indicate no signal, to NA.}

\item{center_in}{logical, whether to shift data so smallest value
is equal to \emph{min_to} input parameter.}

\item{zero_value}{integer, indicating voxels values which are considered
not to have any information. If left empty,
then the smallest HU value in the image will be used, if \emph{replace_in} is TRUE.}

\item{min_to}{integer, value to which data is shifted to if \emph{center_in} is TRUE.}

\item{header_add}{dataframe, with three columns: Name, Group and Element containing the name,
the group and the element code of the DICOM fields wished to be added to the\emph{RIA_header}.}

\item{header_exclude}{dataframe, with three columns: Name, Group and Element containing the name,
the group and the element code of the DICOM fields wished to be excluded
from the default header elements present in \emph{DICOM_codes} rda file.}

\item{verbose_in}{logical, indicating whether to print detailed information.
Most prints can also be suppresed using the \code{\link{suppressMessages}} function.}

\item{recursive_in}{\emph{recursive} parameter input of \code{\link[oro.dicom]{readDICOM}}.}

\item{exclude_in}{\emph{exclude} parameter input of \code{\link[oro.dicom]{readDICOM}}.}

\item{mode_in}{\emph{mode} parameter input of \code{\link[oro.dicom]{create3D}}.}

\item{transpose_in}{\emph{transpose} parameter input of \code{\link[oro.dicom]{create3D}}.}

\item{pixelData_in}{\emph{pixelData} parameter input of \code{\link[oro.dicom]{create3D}}.}

\item{mosaic_in}{\emph{mosaic} parameter input of \code{\link[oro.dicom]{create3D}}.}

\item{mosaicXY_in}{\emph{mosaicXY} parameter input of \code{\link[oro.dicom]{create3D}}.}

\item{sequence_in}{\emph{sequence} parameter input of \code{\link[oro.dicom]{create3D}}.}

\item{...}{additional arguments to  \code{\link[oro.dicom]{readDICOM}},
\code{\link[oro.dicom]{readDICOMFile}} and \code{\link[oro.dicom]{create3D}}.}

\description{
Loads DICOM images to a \emph{RIA_image} object.
\emph{RIA_image} is a  list with three mandatory attributes.
\itemize{
 \item \bold{RIA_data} is a \emph{RIA_data} object, which has two potential slots.
 \emph{$orig} contains the original image after loading and is a 3D array of integers
 created with \code{\link[oro.dicom]{create3D}}.
 \emph{$modif} contains the image that has been modified using functions.
 \item \bold{RIA_header} is a \emph{RIA_header} object, which is list of DICOM header information.
 \item \bold{RIA_log} is a \emph{RIA_log} object, which is a list updated by RIA functions
 and acts as a log and possible input for some functions.
 }
 Further attributes may also be added by RIA functions.

\details{
\emph{load_dicom} is used to transform DICOM datasets into the RIA environment.
\emph{RIA_image} object was developed to facilitate and simplify radiomics calculations by keeping
all necessary information in one place.
\cr
\cr
\emph{RIA_data} stores the DICOM image that is converted to numerical 3D arrays using
\code{\link[oro.dicom]{readDICOM}} and \code{\link[oro.dicom]{create3D}}.
The function stores the original loaded image in  \emph{RIA_data$orig},
while all modified images are stored in \emph{RIA_data$modif}.
By default, the original image \emph{RIA_data$orig} is untouched by functions
other than those operating in \emph{load_dicom}. While other functions
operate on the \emph{RIA_data$modif} image by default.
\cr
Due to memory concerns, there can only be one \emph{RIA_data$orig} and \emph{RIA_data$modif}
image present at one time in a \emph{RIA_image}. Therefore, if image manipulations are performed,
then the \emph{RIA_data$modif} will be overwritten. However, functions can save images
into new slots of \emph{RIA_image}, for example discretized images can be saved to the \emph{discretized} slot of \emph{RIA_image}.
\cr
\emph{load_dicom} not only loads the DICOM image based on parameters that can be set for
\code{\link[oro.dicom]{readDICOM}} and \code{\link[oro.dicom]{create3D}}, but also can perform
minimal manipulations on the image itself.
\cr
\emph{crop_in} logical variable is used to indicate, whether to crop the image to the
smallest bounding box still containing all the information. If TRUE, then all X, Y and potentially
Z slices containing no information will be removed. This allows significant reduction of necessary
memory to store image data.
\cr
\emph{zero_value} parameter is used to indicate HU values which contain no information. If left empty,
then the smallest value will be considered as indicating voxels without a signal.
\cr
\emph{replace_in} logical can be used to change values that are considered to have no signal to NA.
This is necessary to receive proper statistical values later on.
\cr
\emph{center_in} logical is used to indicate whether the values should be shifted.
Some vendors save HU values as positive integers to spare memory and minimalize file sizes.
Therefore, in some instances shift of the scale is needed. By default,
the values are shifted by -1024, but in other cases a different constant might be required,
which can be set using the \emph{min_to} input.
\cr
\cr
\emph{RIA_header} is a list containing the most basic patient and examination information
needed for further analysis. The default DICOM set is present in \emph{DICOM_codes},
which can be edited to anyones needs. But if we wish only to add of remove specific
DICOM header rows, then the \emph{header_add} and \emph{header_exclude} can be used.
\cr
\cr
\emph{RIA_log} is a list of variables, which give an overview of what has been done with the image.
If the whole \emph{RIA_image} is supplied to a function, the information regarding the manipulations
are written into the \emph{$events} array in chronological order. Furthermore, some additional
information is also saved in the log, which might be needed for further analysis.
